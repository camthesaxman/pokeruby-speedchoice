# Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire (Speedchoice BETA 4.1)

WARNING: This is a beta and may still crash in very specific scenarios. Play at your own peril.

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby. It is used in Ruby Bingo and requires the following altered version of Dabomstew's randomizer: https://mega.nz/#!ahhDUDJA!edjmY_xISyD5f1BTduLhzQiH0DGLGu9y7N00uKcjHFA as using the normal one will cause a crash at New Game due to shifted offsets.

It builds the following roms:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: 0d0b813d12e5dcb266d88b0953041c3a2dd794ff`
* pokesapphire.gba: `sha1: 152c2b237d46836309f005fc3b2e062f35a1ed02`
