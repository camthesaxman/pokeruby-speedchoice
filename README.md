# Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire (Speedchoice BETA 5)

WARNING: This is a beta and may still crash in very specific scenarios. Play at your own peril.

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby. It is used in Ruby/Sapphire Bingo and requires the following altered version of Dabomstew's randomizer: https://mega.nz/#!LxpgWCxD!GiXWvk8IaUS5Kbz2icKyQxjZ4c1q7ZJsxYLzkJNLPQA as using the normal one will cause a crash at New Game due to shifted offsets.

It builds the following roms:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: b25cebeafd9c7efe1aad79cb9838d558f51faece`
* pokesapphire.gba: `sha1: 89316d0c280a441fa084d47c3b4713ff4803c9ad`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
