# Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire (Speedchoice BETA)

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby. It is used in Ruby Bingo and requires the following altered version of Dabomstew's randomizer: https://mega.nz/#!Cw4wgBiQ!r67JaLhKnbw611QYnLDXLF5tyzrnKTp8wCWWE5eaQLs as using the normal one will cause a crash at New Game due to shifted offsets.

It builds the following roms:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: 581d33a3b526670bc5073bbb6fe7705bd02e85e0`
* pokesapphire.gba: `sha1: fa6f22762b4f0a1904a18a7ed222b1442b2676a7`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
