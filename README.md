# Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire (Speedchoice BETA)

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby. It is used in Ruby Bingo and requires the following altered version of Dabomstew's randomizer: https://mega.nz/#!Cw4wgBiQ!r67JaLhKnbw611QYnLDXLF5tyzrnKTp8wCWWE5eaQLs as using the normal one will cause a crash at New Game due to shifted offsets.

It builds the following roms:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: a178d6bf3b032243bde9ff8edc337a297bf7bd65`
* pokesapphire.gba: `sha1: 463ccd7e14ff79b26e5883d8f694e81373eca47f`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
