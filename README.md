# Pokémon Ruby (Speedchoice BETA)

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby.

It builds the following rom:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: f28b6ffc97847e94a6c21a63cacf633ee5c8df1e`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

The music right now is distorted and unplayable. This is only a proof of concept.
