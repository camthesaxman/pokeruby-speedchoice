# Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire (Speedchoice BETA 4)

WARNING: This is a beta and may still crash in very specific scenarios. Play at your own peril.

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby. It is used in Ruby Bingo and requires the following altered version of Dabomstew's randomizer: https://mega.nz/#!Top3hKDB!WRLQ9DiGn_di4_EjVGyvknycORiK3z5xGRLlW8LHkZU as using the normal one will cause a crash at New Game due to shifted offsets.

It builds the following roms:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: 5079a5fa863adbe26fdb3a951d3d443f65e4fd8a`
* pokesapphire.gba: `sha1: 4340b4f514099d69c164b0c19ca454d0500a8f0d`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
