# Pokémon Ruby (Speedchoice BETA)

This is a fork of the disassembly of Pokémon Ruby. It is used in Ruby Bingo and requires the following altered version of Dabomstew's randomizer: https://mega.nz/#!Cw4wgBiQ!r67JaLhKnbw611QYnLDXLF5tyzrnKTp8wCWWE5eaQLs as using the normal one will cause a crash at New Game due to shifted offsets.

It builds the following roms:

* pokeruby.gba `sha1: f28b6ffc97847e94a6c21a63cacf633ee5c8df1e`
* pokesapphire.gba `sha1: 3ccbbd45f8553c36463f13b938e833f652b793e4`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
